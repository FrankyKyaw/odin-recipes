        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound russet potato</li>
            <li>1 large green bell pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 dried red chiles</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons of rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a medium sized bowl with cold water and start peeling the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Shred them with a mandoline or just cut them. You want them to be long thin matchsticks.</li>
            <li>Submerge them in water for about 30 minutes to rinse off excess starch.</li>
            <li>Cut the bell pepper in half lengthwise and discard the stems and seeds and cut them into the same long thin matchsticks.</li>
            <li>Pat the potatoes dry and add 2 teaspoons of oil in the pan.</li>
            <li>Add 2 of the chiles and stir them until they start to blacken.</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes and bell peppers and stir fry them vigorously.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with salt as you stir fry. Once the stir fry is done, turn off the heat and add vinegar.</li>
            <li>Stir to mix well before serving the dish.</li>
        </ol>
